SELECT salary 
FROM (
    SELECT salary, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rn
    FROM employee
    WHERE salary IS NOT NULL
)
WHERE rn = :N;

-- Method 2: Using DENSE_RANK() - Handles duplicates better
SELECT DISTINCT salary 
FROM (
    SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rnk

    FROM employee
    WHERE salary IS NOT NULL
)
WHERE rank_num = :N;

-- Method 4: Using ROWNUM (Oracle-specific)
SELECT salary
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT salary
    FROM employee
    WHERE salary IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY salary DESC
)
WHERE ROWNUM = :N;

-- Method 5: Using OFFSET and FETCH (Oracle 12c+)

                question: 'Explain JOIN and different types of JOIN in Oracle SQL.',

                question: 'How can you optimize an Oracle SQL query for better performance?',
                answer: 'Query optimization in Oracle involves proper indexing, execution plan analysis, hint usage, and understanding the cost-based optimizer.',
                language: 'Oracle SQL',
                code: `-- 1. Use proper indexes

-- 2. Check execution plan
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR

SELECT * FROM TABLE(DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY);

-- 3. Use bind variables instead of literals
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = :emp_id;

-- 4. Avoid SELECT *
SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary 
FROM employees 
WHERE department_id = 10;

-- 5. Use EXISTS instead of IN for subqueries
SELECT * FROM departments d
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM employees e WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id);

-- 6. Use analytical functions instead of self-joins
SELECT employee_id, salary,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as salary_rank
FROM employees;

-- 7. Use ROWNUM for limiting results (Oracle-specific)
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC
) WHERE ROWNUM <= 10;

-- 8. Oracle 12c+ OFFSET FETCH syntax
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY;`

                question: 'What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR2 data types in Oracle?',
                answer: 'CHAR has a fixed length whereas VARCHAR2 has a variable length. CHAR always uses the same amount of storage space per entry, while VARCHAR2 uses only the space required.',
                language: 'Oracle SQL',
                code: `-- CHAR vs VARCHAR2 comparison
CREATE TABLE data_types_demo (

-- Insert examples
INSERT INTO data_types_demo VALUES (1, 'ABC', 'ABC');
INSERT INTO data_types_demo VALUES (2, 'HELLO', 'HELLO');

-- Check actual lengths
SELECT id,

SELECT * FROM data_types_demo 
WHERE fixed_char = 'ABC';    -- May not match due to padding

SELECT * FROM data_types_demo

-- Best practices
-- Use CHAR for fixed-length data like codes, flags
-- Use VARCHAR2 for variable-length data like names, descriptions`

                question: 'Write a query to retrieve duplicate records from a table without using the DISTINCT keyword.',
                answer: 'Use GROUP BY with HAVING clause to find duplicate records based on specific columns.',
                language: 'Oracle SQL',
                code: `-- Find duplicate records using GROUP BY and HAVING
SELECT column_name, COUNT(column_name) as duplicate_count
FROM table_name 
GROUP BY column_name 
HAVING COUNT(column_name) > 1;

-- Example: Find employees with duplicate email addresses
SELECT email, COUNT(email) as email_count

-- Find duplicates based on multiple columns
SELECT first_name, last_name, department_id, COUNT(*) as duplicate_count

FROM employees e

    SELECT email
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY email
    HAVING COUNT(email) > 1
) duplicates ON e.email = duplicates.email

                question: 'What are the differences between UNION and UNION ALL in Oracle?',
                answer: 'UNION combines the result sets of two or more queries and removes duplicates. UNION ALL combines result sets but does not remove duplicates.',
                language: 'Oracle SQL',
                code: `-- UNION: Removes duplicates and sorts results (slower)
SELECT employee_id, first_name FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10
UNION
SELECT employee_id, first_name FROM employees WHERE department_id = 20;

-- UNION ALL: Keeps all rows including duplicates (faster)
SELECT employee_id, first_name FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10
UNION ALL
SELECT employee_id, first_name FROM employees WHERE department_id = 20;

-- Performance comparison
-- UNION performs sorting and duplicate removal
-- UNION ALL is faster as it doesn't sort or remove duplicates

-- Example with different data types (must be compatible)
SELECT employee_id, first_name, 'EMPLOYEE' as record_type FROM employees
UNION ALL
SELECT department_id, department_name, 'DEPARTMENT' as record_type FROM departments;

-- Real-world example: Combining current and archived data
SELECT order_id, customer_id, order_date, 'ACTIVE' as status
FROM current_orders
UNION ALL
SELECT order_id, customer_id, order_date, 'ARCHIVED' as status
FROM archived_orders
ORDER BY order_date DESC;

-- When to use UNION vs UNION ALL:
-- Use UNION when you need unique records across sets
-- Use UNION ALL when you want all records including duplicates
-- UNION ALL is generally preferred for performance unless duplicates must be removed`

                question: 'How can you fetch alternate records from a table in Oracle?',
                answer: 'Use ROW_NUMBER() analytical function with MOD function to fetch odd or even positioned records.',

                language: 'Oracle SQL',
                code: `-- Basic syntax for modifying column data type
ALTER TABLE employees MODIFY (salary NUMBER(10,2));

-- Create test table for demonstration
CREATE TABLE data_type_demo (
    id NUMBER,
    text_col VARCHAR2(50),
    number_col NUMBER,
    date_col DATE
);

INSERT INTO data_type_demo VALUES (1, '12345', 100, SYSDATE);
INSERT INTO data_type_demo VALUES (2, 'Hello', 200, SYSDATE-1);

-- Example 1: Increase VARCHAR2 size
ALTER TABLE data_type_demo MODIFY (text_col VARCHAR2(100));

-- Example 2: Change NUMBER precision
ALTER TABLE data_type_demo MODIFY (number_col NUMBER(10,2));

-- Example 3: Converting compatible types
-- VARCHAR2 to NUMBER (data must be numeric)
UPDATE data_type_demo SET text_col = '999' WHERE id = 2;
ALTER TABLE data_type_demo MODIFY (text_col NUMBER);

-- Reverting back for next example
ALTER TABLE data_type_demo MODIFY (text_col VARCHAR2(100));
UPDATE data_type_demo SET text_col = 'Hello' WHERE id = 2;

-- Example 4: Converting with data transformation
-- Step 1: Add new column with desired type
ALTER TABLE data_type_demo ADD (new_text_col CLOB);

-- Step 2: Copy and transform data
UPDATE data_type_demo SET new_text_col = text_col;

-- Step 3: Drop old column
ALTER TABLE data_type_demo DROP COLUMN text_col;

-- Step 4: Rename new column
ALTER TABLE data_type_demo RENAME COLUMN new_text_col TO text_col;

-- Example 5: Safe conversion process for complex changes
-- Create backup table
CREATE TABLE data_type_demo_backup AS SELECT * FROM data_type_demo;

-- Complex conversion: VARCHAR2 to DATE
ALTER TABLE data_type_demo ADD (temp_date_col DATE);

-- Convert data with proper handling

    THEN TO_DATE(text_col, 'YYYY-MM-DD')

SELECT text_col, temp_date_col FROM data_type_demo;

-- Example 6: Multiple column modifications
ALTER TABLE data_type_demo MODIFY (

-- Example 7: Adding constraints during modification
ALTER TABLE data_type_demo MODIFY (
    id NUMBER(10) NOT NULL,

);

-- Example 8: Handling constraints during type changes
-- View existing constraints
SELECT constraint_name, constraint_type, column_name

-- Disable constraints if needed
-- ALTER TABLE data_type_demo DISABLE CONSTRAINT constraint_name;

-- Modify column
-- ALTER TABLE data_type_demo MODIFY (column_name NEW_TYPE);

-- Re-enable constraints
-- ALTER TABLE data_type_demo ENABLE CONSTRAINT constraint_name;

-- Example 9: Check data compatibility before conversion
-- Check if all values in number_col can be converted to INTEGER
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_rows,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN MOD(number_col, 1) = 0 THEN 1 END) as integer_compatible

-- View current column definitions
SELECT column_name, data_type, data_length, data_precision, data_scale, nullable
FROM user_tab_columns
WHERE table_name = 'DATA_TYPE_DEMO'
ORDER BY column_id;

-- Common conversion scenarios and best practices:

-- 1. VARCHAR2 size increase: Always safe
-- ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY (column_name VARCHAR2(new_larger_size));

-- 2. VARCHAR2 size decrease: Check data first
-- SELECT MAX(LENGTH(column_name)) FROM table_name;

-- 3. NUMBER precision increase: Usually safe
-- ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY (column_name NUMBER(larger_precision, scale));

-- 4. NUMBER to VARCHAR2: Usually safe
-- ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY (column_name VARCHAR2(sufficient_size));

-- 5. VARCHAR2 to NUMBER: Validate data first
-- SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE NOT REGEXP_LIKE(column_name, '^-?\d+(\.\d+)?);

-- 6. DATE to VARCHAR2: Safe with proper formatting
-- ALTER TABLE table_name ADD (temp_col VARCHAR2(19));
-- UPDATE table_name SET temp_col = TO_CHAR(date_col, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS');

-- 7. VARCHAR2 to DATE: Validate format first
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL 
-- AND NOT REGEXP_LIKE(column_name, '^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}');

-- Clean up
DROP TABLE data_type_demo;
DROP TABLE data_type_demo_backup;

-- Important notes:
-- 1. Always backup data before major conversions
-- 2. Test conversions on development environment first
-- 3. Check for data loss during precision reduction
-- 4. Consider impact on indexes and constraints
-- 5. Update application code if data types change
-- 6. Some conversions may require table recreation`
