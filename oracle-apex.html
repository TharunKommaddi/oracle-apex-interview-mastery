        question: 'What are the 4 essential security pillars that every Oracle APEX application should implement?',
        answer: 'According to Oracle APEX security best practices, the 4 essential security pillars are: 1. Authentication - Verifies the user\'s identity using methods like APEX accounts, LDAP, SSO, or OAuth2. This should be implemented in every APEX app, even internal ones, as no login equals an open door to your application. 2. Authorization - Defines what users can access by setting user permissions. Admins typically see all data while regular users see limited data. This is crucial when your app supports roles, restricted pages, or conditional visibility. 3. Session State Protection - Prevents users from manipulating hidden values and protects against URL tampering or form field injection by securing item values. Use Session State Protection on critical or hidden items, especially those passed between pages. 4. SQL Injection Prevention - Protects your app from malicious input that could compromise your database. Always use bind variables, sanitize user input, and avoid direct string concatenation in SQL.',
