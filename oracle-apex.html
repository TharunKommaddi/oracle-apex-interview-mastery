Authorization - Defines what users can access by setting user permissions. Admins typically see all data while regular users see limited data. This is crucial when your app supports roles, restricted pages, or conditional visibility.<br><br>3. Session State Protection - Prevents users from manipulating hidden values and protects against URL tampering or form field injection by securing item values. Use Session State Protection on critical or hidden items, especially those passed between pages.<br><br>4. SQL Injection Prevention - Protects your app from malicious input that could compromise your database. Always use bind variables, sanitize user input, and avoid direct string concatenation in SQL.',
